# RoboCup

A RoboCup Player/Team example.

The players interact with each other using sockets. The players operate in a multi-threaded environment using pthreads. They are capable of simultaneous parsing, decision making (using a Behavior Tree), and sending data to server.

Can be customized by rewriting the Brain file or extending/replacing the Behavior tree.
